            <p>
                There are several methods defined on the document object to access individual elements.
                <span class = "important info">The recommended method is the simplest one: getElementById().</span> 
                Note that any HTML element can have an id attribute. 
                <span class = "important warning">The value of the id attribute must be unique within the document.</span>
            </p>
